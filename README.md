Connecting resource organizations and undocumented students

ABSTRACT
There's one document everyone in the United States should have access to: a college degree. UndocUHelp supports students on their path to educational success. Our platform brings together organizations that support undocumented students to share information and resources in a single, easy-to-navigate directory, helping students discover the help they need, when they need it.

SAMPLE USER STORIES

o	As an undocumented student, I want to find organizations with people that can advise me on what to do with the processes involving my legal status.

STATEMENT OF IMPACT
There is only about 5-10% of the undocumented immigrant population enrolling in higher education each year. From that small percentage, just 1-3% graduate. Undocumented students face many struggles that affect their hopes of becoming college students and succeeding in college; however, today there are numerous organizations that are available to provide help and guidance to these students. There are various organizations that provide legal, academic and career advising at no cost; as well as these serving as safe spaces that undocumented students can trust, that also give these students the opportunity of meeting other individuals that also go through the same challenges. Through extensive user research, the UndocUHelp team determined that connecting these resource organizations and undocumented students through technology is a great way of providing students with all the help and guidance they need to enroll in and be successful in college. UndocUHelp provides resource organizations a platform where they can publish their contact information, links, and post events; which can be seen by undocumented students. Users can anonymously enter the platform to browse organizations and events in the area of their choosing. This provides undocumented students with all the information they need to contact organizations and attend events; where they can interact in-person and receive professional guidance and meet new people in safe spaces.
