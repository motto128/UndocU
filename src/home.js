                      There is only about <strong> 5-10% </strong> of the undocumented immigrant population enrolling in higher education each year. From that small percentage, just <strong> 1-3% </strong> graduate. 
                      These miniscule percentages seem alarming, specially for undocumented students, who face tougher challenges 
                      in today's society.
